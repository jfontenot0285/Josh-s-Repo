I created simple chatbot on pandorabots.com and this is the source AIML code for it. If you copy the code into your own pandorabots project you can see it in action. The bot is designed to offer career advice to students of computer science. It works by asking probing questions and guaging how the user thinks. It's not super sophisticated - I mainly used conditionals to navigate through the bot's templates in a tree-like fashion.
